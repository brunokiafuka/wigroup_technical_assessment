### Questions ###

Please attempt as much questions as you can; while using modules such as redux, redux-thunk, react-navigation or the equivalent ReactJS modules or other modules.

* Auto-Search App : Create a single screen app that has one text input that accepts a valid URL and then immediately loads the web-page in a webview/iframe component.

* Wikipedia App:  Create an app that accepts keywords/texts, performs a GET request on Wikipedia and displays the results in a list just below the text input. Afterwards, when a user clicks on row, he should be navigated to a detailed screen which has a navigation bar [ with its title being the Wikipedia page ] and a webview/iframe component to load that page.

* AsyncStorage/LocalStorage App: Create an app that has 3 dummy screens. On screen 1, there should be a username and password field and a save button. On saving, the app stores the credential in the AsysnStorage/LocalStorage of the phone. When you quit it and open it, it should navigate immediately to screen 2. On screen 2, place a button to navigate to screen 3. We should be able to navigate to screen 2 from screen 3.
